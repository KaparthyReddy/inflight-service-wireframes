Figma wireframes for an in-flight service app, enabling passengers to access food, entertainment, and seat-related services mid-flight.

# üõ´ In-Flight Service App Wireframes

This repository includes wireframes and a Figma prototype for an in-flight companion app designed to enhance the passenger experience. The app allows users to order food, access entertainment, request assistance, and manage seat preferences directly from their devices while on board.
